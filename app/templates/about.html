  <h1>
    With the massive success of the Portal Gun (See File: Portal 2), GlaDOS decided that it was time to utilize Portal technology to create puzzles for everyone to solve. We, The Hard Inting Ducks, are a branch of devos that worked under GlaDOS on this project. 
  After the recent completion of the prototype of this project, she told the Hard Inting Ducks to find play testers. So without further ado, this is the Wordle Portle.

    The Wordle Portle is a prototype creation designed for the sole purpose of indoctronati- I mean puzzling entertainment. This prototype currently has 2 games for people of all ages, and 1 game designed for the advanced and horribly misguided lifeforms.
  Wordle is the classic game that needs no introduction. Nerdle is a spinoff that requires math equations. Yordle is the game previously mentioned for the "interesting lifeforms". For those of you who already recognized the name Yordle, I am terribly sorry for the time
  you must have wasted on this game. Three members of the Hard Inting Ducks have also lost our time playing this game. Yordle is based on the MOBA game league of legends, but do not fear it is not as toxic or tilting. Enjoy the show!
