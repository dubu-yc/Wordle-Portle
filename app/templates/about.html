    With the massive success of the Portal Gun (See File: Portal 2), GlaDOS decided that it was time to utilize Portal technology to create puzzles for everyone to solve. We, The Hard Inting Ducks, are a branch of devos that worked under GlaDOS on this project. 
  After the recent completion of the prototype of this project, she told the Hard Inting Ducks to find play testers. So without further ado, this is the Wordle Portle.

    The Wordle Portle is a prototype creation designed for the sole purpose of indoctronati- I mean puzzling entertainment.
